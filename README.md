# Parallelism Vs. Concurrency in Python

Simple demonstrator for the difference between using processes and threads (parallel and concurrent, respectively) in Python.

To run the concurrency test:
```sh
make run-concurrency-test
```

To run the parallelism test:
```sh
make run-parallelism-test
```

The important time to keep an eye on is labeled "total".
